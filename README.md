# Digital Mapping Workshop

Welcome to the workshop. We're talking about digital mapping today. No experience required.

We'll be cover three straightforward questions: what is digital mapping?, why might you want to map?, and how can you get started?

**But first, a map...**

## What is Digital Mapping?

### Some Basics

* By *digital mapping* I mean **GIS**
  * Geographic Information Science/Systems
* Ususually 1 or more sets of spatial data layered on top of a basemap



### Vector Data

* Points

* Lines

* Polygons

### Raster Data

Raster data as akin to laying a grid over the landscape. Each of the squares in the grid can hold a single valueâ€”in the example below, it is a numeric code representing different geographic area types.

The *size* of the squares will determine how closely the map matches the real world that it is representing.

### Layering It All Together

Digital maps are usually made up of one or more layers of spatial data (vector, raster, or both) on top of some kind of basemap (which itself is just another layer of spatial data).
